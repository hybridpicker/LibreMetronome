# Libre Metronome

## Overview

Libre Metronome is a modern, minimalist, and intuitive digital metronome application that merges classic musical functionality with a contemporary user interface. The application integrates analog elements (such as a circular display and an oscillating pointer) with modern technologies to provide musicians and educators with a powerful and flexible tool. The frontend is built in React, while the backend is based on Django, with a REST API for future enhancements like user management and preset functionality.

## Version 0.1.0 | Beta Release
### Features

- **Circular Display:**  
  A circular interface reminiscent of an analog clock or rotary dial. Subdivisions are displayed as markers, with the first beat always accentuated and visually distinguished.

- **Dynamic Pointer:**  
  An animated pointer that shows the progression of beats in real-time. The pointer features a dynamic line width and a subtle glow effect to enhance the visual rhythm.

- **Interactive Controls:**  
  Easily adjustable parameters such as tempo, swing, and volume. The swing and volume values are displayed as percentages (0â€“100%), while the tempo is displayed in BPM.

- **Keyboard Interaction:**  
  In addition to mouse or touch controls, the application supports keyboard shortcuts (e.g., Space to start/pause, numeric keys to adjust subdivisions, and "T" for tap tempo).

- **Web Audio Integration:**  
  Uses the Web Audio API to ensure precise beat timing, with customizable accents and volume levels per beat.

- **REST API Backend:**  
  The Django-based backend includes a REST API for managing metronome settings, presets, and future user authentication.

## Technologies

- **Frontend:**  
  - React, JavaScript, HTML, CSS  
    (Modern frontend technologies for a responsive and user-friendly interface.)

- **Backend:**  
  - Django, Django REST Framework, Python  
    (A robust and scalable backend architecture, with RESTful endpoints for future enhancements.)
